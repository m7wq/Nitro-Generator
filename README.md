- Install the downloaded JRE/JDK.

2. **Set the JAVA_HOME Environment Variable:**

- Update your JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the newly installed JDK/JRE.
- Ensure your system PATH includes the bin directory of the new JDK/JRE.

3. **Compile the Java File:**

- Use the javac command to compile the Java file. Make sure you are in the src directory:

```sh
cd /path/to/src
javac org/tempmahmoud/Main.java
```
- This command generates the Main.class file in the org/tempmahmoud/ directory.

4. **Run the Compiled Class:**

- Run the compiled class using the fully qualified name from the root of the source directory:
```sh
java org.tempmahmoud.Main
```
